Approaches to unsupervised learning
1. Clustering

Definition: Clustering involves grouping similar data points into clusters based on their similarity. It is a foundational method in unsupervised learning.

Key algorithms

    k-means: This algorithm partitions data into k clusters based on the distance between data points. Each data point is assigned to the cluster with the nearest centroid.

    Hierarchical clustering: This builds a tree of clusters by either iteratively merging or splitting clusters based on their proximity.

    Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN): This algorithm groups data points based on their density and can find clusters of arbitrary shapes, including noise points.

Applications: Customer segmentation, social network analysis, image segmentation, and document clustering

Example: A retail company can use clustering to segment customers based on purchasing behavior, creating distinct groups such as budget shoppers, frequent buyers, and luxury spenders.
2. Dimensionality reduction

Definition: Dimensionality reduction is the process of reducing the number of features (dimensions) in a dataset while retaining as much information as possible.

Key algorithms

    Principal component analysis: This technique transforms the data into a new coordinate system such that the first few principal components (new axes) explain the most variance in the data.

    t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding: This nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique is particularly effective for visualizing high-dimensional data in a lower-dimensional space (such as 2D or 3D).

    Autoencoders: These neural networks are designed to learn a compressed representation of input data, making them effective for feature reduction and data reconstruction.

Applications: Reducing noise in data, simplifying visualization of high-dimensional datasets, and speeding up training for ML models

Example: In genetics, researchers can use dimensionality reduction techniques to compress large datasets of gene expression data, allowing them to focus on the most significant factors affecting disease outcomes.
3. Anomaly detection

Definition: Anomaly detection aims to identify data points that deviate significantly from the majority of the data. These data points are considered anomalies or outliers.

Key algorithms

    Isolation forest: This tree-based algorithm isolates anomalies by randomly partitioning the data.

    k-means for outlier detection: Clusters are identified, and points farthest from any cluster centroid can be flagged as anomalies.

    Autoencoders for anomaly detection: Autoencoders can learn normal data patterns and identify anomalies based on high reconstruction errors.

Applications: Fraud detection in finance, equipment failure detection in manufacturing, and network intrusion detection in cybersecurity

Example: Banks use anomaly detection algorithms to flag unusual credit card transactions that may indicate fraudulent activity.
4. Association rule learning

Definition: This technique identifies relationships between variables in large datasets. Association rules are often used in market basket analysis to discover product combinations that frequently occur together.

Key algorithms

    Apriori: This algorithm discovers frequent itemsets and builds association rules in a dataset by identifying patterns of co-occurrence.

    Eclat: An alternative to Apriori, Eclat uses depth-first search to discover frequent item sets in a dataset.

Applications: Retail basket analysis, recommendation systems, and correlation identification between product sales

Example: An online retailer might use association rules to identify that customers who buy laptops often purchase laptop cases, leading to more effective product bundling or cross-selling strategies.
When to use unsupervised learning

Exploratory analysis: When you have a large, unlabeled dataset and want to discover patterns, unsupervised learning provides valuable insights.

Data compression: For high-dimensional data in which training supervised models is computationally expensive, unsupervised learning can reduce dimensionality and streamline model training.

Pattern recognition: This is useful when the goal is to find natural groupings within the data, such as clustering users by behavior or identifying outliers for anomaly detection.

Preprocessing step: Unsupervised learning is often used to preprocess data before applying supervised learning models, improving accuracy and performance by filtering out irrelevant or redundant features.
