Let us now discuss the fundamental building blocks of thermodynamic AI hardware. As the name suggests, a thermodynamic system is inherently dynamic in nature. Therefore, the fundamental building blocks should also be dynamic. This is contrast to classical bits or qubits, where the state of the system ideally remains fixed unless it is actively changed by gates. The thermodynamic building block should passively and naturally evolve over time, even without the application of gates. But what dynamical process should it follow? A reasonable proposal is a stochastic Markov process. Naturally this should be continuous in time, since no time point is more special than any other time point. Hence, the discrete building block, which we call an s-bit, would follow a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC). Here the “s” in s-bit stands for stochastic. For the continuous building block, which we call an s-mode, the natural analog would be a Brownian motion (also known a Wiener process). We use s-unit as a generic term to encompass both s-bits and s-modes. We note that stochastic building blocks were also considered by Mansinghka et al. using digital58 logic, which is different from our (analog) approach
