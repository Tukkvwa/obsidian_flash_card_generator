What is supervised learning? ;; A foundational approach in machine learning that empowers machines to learn from labeled data and make predictions on unseen data.
What are the two main types of supervised learning problems? ;; Classification and regression.
What is the essence of supervised learning? ;; The use of labeled data.
What does "labeled data" mean in supervised learning? ;; Each input in the dataset is paired with a corresponding output, which serves as the "ground truth" from which the model learns.
What are examples of labeled data in a spam email detection system? ;; Emails are labeled as "spam" or "not spam."
What is the purpose of training in supervised learning? ;; To adjust the internal parameters of the model to minimize errors in prediction.
What does "generalization" refer to in supervised learning? ;; The model's ability to perform well on new data, meaning it has learned the underlying patterns of the problem rather than just memorizing the training examples.
What is overfitting? ;; When a model performs well on the training data but fails on new, unseen data.
What is the goal in classification tasks? ;; To assign the input data to one of several predefined categories or classes.
What is the output type in regression tasks? ;; A continuous numerical value.
What algorithm is commonly used for binary classification despite its name? ;; Logistic regression.
What type of algorithm is linear regression? ;; A regression algorithm.
What makes decision trees versatile? ;; They can be used for both classification and regression tasks.
What is the advantage of random forests over single decision trees? ;; By averaging the results of multiple trees, random forests reduce the risk of overfitting and increase robustness.
What makes neural networks particularly useful? ;; They are highly flexible and can model complex, nonlinear relationships between inputs and outputs.
What are the key steps in building supervised learning models? ;; Data collection and preparation, model training, model evaluation, model tuning, and deployment and maintenance.
What is the purpose of model tuning? ;; To improve the model by adjusting hyperparameters that control the learning process.
What metrics are commonly used to evaluate classification models? ;; Accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC.
What metrics are commonly used to evaluate regression models? ;; Mean squared error and R-squared.
Why is it important to continuously monitor a deployed model? ;; To ensure it remains accurate as new data becomes available.
What techniques can be used to find optimal hyperparameters? ;; Grid search or random search.
How do Support Vector Machines (SVMs) work? ;; They try to find the optimal hyperplane that separates the data points from different classes.
What makes k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) a nonparametric algorithm? ;; It doesn't make assumptions about the data distribution.
What is a potential drawback of k-NN as datasets grow? ;; It can become computationally expensive.
What applications are neural networks especially useful for? ;; Image recognition, natural language processing, and deep learning applications.
