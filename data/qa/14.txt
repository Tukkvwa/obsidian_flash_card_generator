What is the inherent nature of a thermodynamic system? ;; It is inherently dynamic in nature.
How should the fundamental building blocks of thermodynamic AI hardware behave compared to classical bits or qubits? ;; They should be dynamic and passively evolve over time, rather than remaining fixed unless actively changed by gates.
What should the fundamental building blocks of thermodynamic AI hardware do without the application of gates? ;; They should passively and naturally evolve over time.
What dynamical process is proposed for thermodynamic building blocks? ;; A stochastic Markov process.
Why should the process be continuous in time? ;; Because no time point is more special than any other time point.
What is an s-bit? ;; The discrete building block that follows a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC).
What does the "s" in s-bit stand for? ;; Stochastic.
What is the continuous-time process that s-bits follow? ;; A continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC).
What is an s-mode? ;; The continuous building block that follows a Brownian motion process.
What is the natural analog process for s-modes? ;; Brownian motion (also known as a Wiener process).
What is the generic term used to encompass both s-bits and s-modes? ;; S-unit.
What is another name for Brownian motion? ;; Wiener process.
How does the approach described differ from Mansinghka et al.'s work? ;; This approach is analog, while Mansinghka et al. used digital logic.
What is the key difference between classical bits/qubits and s-units in terms of state evolution? ;; Classical bits/qubits ideally remain fixed unless actively changed, while s-units naturally evolve over time without external intervention.
What type of process characterizes the evolution of discrete thermodynamic building blocks? ;; Continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC).
