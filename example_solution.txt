1) What is clustering in unsupervised learning? ;; Clustering involves grouping similar data points into clusters based on their similarity. It is a foundational method in unsupervised learning.

2) Name three key clustering algorithms. ;; k-means, hierarchical clustering, and density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN).

3) What is k-means clustering? ;; This algorithm partitions data into k clusters based on the distance between data points. Each data point is assigned to the cluster with the nearest centroid.

4) What are some applications of clustering? ;; Customer segmentation, social network analysis, image segmentation, and document clustering.

5) What is dimensionality reduction? ;; The process of reducing the number of features (dimensions) in a dataset while retaining as much information as possible.

6) Name three key dimensionality reduction algorithms. ;; Principal component analysis, t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding, and autoencoders.

7) What are the applications of dimensionality reduction? ;; Reducing noise in data, simplifying visualization of high-dimensional datasets, and speeding up training for ML models.

8) What is anomaly detection? ;; Anomaly detection aims to identify data points that deviate significantly from the majority of the data. These data points are considered anomalies or outliers.

9) Name three algorithms for anomaly detection. ;; Isolation forest, k-means for outlier detection, and autoencoders for anomaly detection.

10) What is association rule learning? ;; A technique that identifies relationships between variables in large datasets. Association rules are often used in market basket analysis to discover product combinations that frequently occur together.

11) Name two key algorithms for association rule learning. ;; Apriori and Eclat.

12) What is an example of association rule learning in retail? ;; An online retailer might use association rules to identify that customers who buy laptops often purchase laptop cases, leading to more effective product bundling or cross-selling strategies.

13) When should you use unsupervised learning for exploratory analysis? ;; When you have a large, unlabeled dataset and want to discover patterns.

14) How is unsupervised learning used in data compression? ;; For high-dimensional data in which training supervised models is computationally expensive, unsupervised learning can reduce dimensionality and streamline model training.

15) How does unsupervised learning fit into an ML pipeline? ;; Unsupervised learning is often used to preprocess data before applying supervised learning models, improving accuracy and performance by filtering out irrelevant or redundant features.
